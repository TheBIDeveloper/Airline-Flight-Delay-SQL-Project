# ✈️ Airline Flight Delay SQL Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing airline flight delay data using **SQL Server** to understand delay patterns, flight performance, and operational trends.

The goal is to help airlines, airport authorities, and analysts make **data-driven decisions** regarding flight scheduling, punctuality, and customer satisfaction.


## ❓ Problem Statement
Flight delays are a major operational challenge for airlines.  
Analysts need insights to:
- Identify flights with frequent delays  
- Understand delay causes (weather, airline, airport)  
- Analyze trends by time, day, and season  
- Optimize schedules and improve on-time performance  

This project addresses these questions using SQL Server on structured flight data.
